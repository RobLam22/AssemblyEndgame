# Assembly: Endgame

A single page application where you are trying to guess the word as quickly as you can before we lose the programming world completely!

**Link to project**: [Assemble: Endgame](https://assemble-endgame.netlify.app/)

## How To Play:

Just like hangman. Guess the right word. Every incorrect guess deletes a programming language entirely!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was a fun little project to enforce my understanding on React state. It shows how React is data-driven, where the input of the user impacts the page.

## Lessons Learned:

Similar to Tenzies, but this project added more components and moving parts.

## Development Ideas:

Inclusion of marathon mode, or multiple sets of 10 dice being rolled.
